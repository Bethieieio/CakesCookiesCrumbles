## Objective
Cakes, Cookies and Crumbles is my fifth and final project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)
I have to demonstrate my understanding of ReactJS front end and Django Rest framework for the backend and having to bare in mind a the focus on design, making sure the viewer has a positive user experience.
Using the Agile methodology is key to help break things own and to keep the project as organised as possible.
In Code Code Institutes words:
> In this project, you will design and build a content-sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End. This will allow your users to browse and comment/ like each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own.
