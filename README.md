## Objective
Cakes, Cookies and Crumbles is my fifth and final project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
I have to demonstrate my understanding of ReactJS front end and Django Rest framework for the backend and having to bare in mind a the focus on design, making sure the viewer has a positive user experience.
Using the Agile methodology is key to help break things own and to keep the project as organised as possible.
In Code Code Institutes words:
> In this project, you will design and build a content-sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End. This will allow your users to browse and comment/ like each other's content as well as add, edit and delete their own. 

## User Experience

### Design Prototype (Wireframes)
For the project, I used [Adobe XD](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/support/xd.html) to create the wireframes. Wireframes help give me an idea of what I want to see the site layout. before I start writing code and to help me think about database structure. One of the main reasons I used XD was because it is a free site. I did not fancy paying for [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) the wireframe site I used last time. I used the 30 day trial in my previous project.
Some of the layout has changed since creating the wireframes eg: new page for sign up and log in.
